# data\_science\_seminar

This weekly seminar series started in January 2021

Slides usually in PowerPoint format.

PDF versions of some of files are placed <br>
into subdirectories <font color="red">"PDF\_versions"</font>

Note:<br>
I tried to also convert to HTML format, <br>
but didn't find a convenient way of doing this.<br>
For example, the aspose online converter is reasonably good,<br>
but unfortunately it doesn't preserve the font type:<br>
